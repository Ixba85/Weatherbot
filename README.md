Automating Weather Updates with a Python Bot on Synology NAS

Have you ever wanted to automate daily weather updates on your social media or website? I recently created a Python bot that fetches and posts weather updates automatically, scheduled directly from my Synology NAS. In this post, I'll walk you through exactly how I did it.

Overview

My goal was simple: automate weather updates at specific times during the day. The bot fetches weather information via an API, formats it, and posts directly to social media (e.g., Twitter). I used Python for scripting, the schedule library for timing, and Synology NAS's built-in Task Scheduler to handle the automation seamlessly.

Technologies Used

Python 3.8

Synology NAS DSM

Schedule library

Tweepy (Twitter API)

Requests library (for HTTP requests)

python-dotenv (secure API keys management)

pytz (for timezone management)
